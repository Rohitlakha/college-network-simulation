## 📌 Project Highlights

### 🧠 Network Design

- Developed a well-structured and logical **network topology** connecting:
  - Computer Department
  - IT Lab
  - Internet Lab
  - Server Room
  - Principal Room
  - Miscellaneous User Groups

### 🧱 Components Used

- **Routers**, **Switches**, **PCs**, **Laptops**, and **Printers**
- **Servers** (DNS, FTP, HTTP, SSH)
- Used **Cisco Packet Tracer** to simulate the entire setup

### 📡 Protocols Implemented

- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** – For dynamic routing between routers
- **SSH (Secure Shell)** – For secure remote management of network devices
