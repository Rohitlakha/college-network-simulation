> **Excited to share my latest computer networks project!**

A **comprehensive LAN (Local Area Network)** setup for a college campus using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, simulating seamless **interdepartmental connectivity**, **secured communication**, and **dynamic routing** using industry-standard protocols.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

### 🧠 Network Design
- Developed a structured **network topology** connecting:
  - Computer Department  
  - IT Lab  
  - Internet Lab  
  - Server Room  
  - Principal Room  
  - Miscellaneous User Groups  

### 🧱 Components Used
- **Routers**, **Switches**, **PCs**, **Laptops**, and **Printers**  
- **Servers** (DNS, FTP, HTTP, SSH)  
- Entire setup simulated on **Cisco Packet Tracer**  

### 📡 Protocols Implemented
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** → Dynamic routing between routers  
- **SSH (Secure Shell)** → Secure remote management of network devices  

---

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved
- ✅ **Modernized Infrastructure** → Upgraded traditional LAN to a scalable, reliable model  
- ✅ **Improved Performance** → Faster & more consistent data transmission  
- ✅ **Scalable Design** → Supports large volumes of devices & departmental expansion  
- ✅ **Enhanced Security** → Secure device access with SSH
